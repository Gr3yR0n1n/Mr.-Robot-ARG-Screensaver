.I'm not speaking to you right now, so I'm writing...
.writing down all the things I would tell you if you
.hadn't betrayed me. I can't trust you, and even though
.I could really use someone to talk to, I'm choosing
.an inanimate piece of paper over you, Hope that
.stings a little.
  
.Well. If I'm being totally honest, this is for you.
.Whether you ever read it or not. Whether we ever
.talk to each other again or not... This is what
.I would tell you and I would start by saying...
.  
. Hello, friend...
.  
. You may wonder why I've put myself-________________
.  
I DON'T LIKE THAT HE IS WRITING ALL THIS TO YOU AND
TRYING TO PUT ME IN DEEP FREEZE HERE, BUT
I'M NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE HELP WHERE I  CAN GET
.IT. YOU'VE GOT TO TALK SOME SENSE TO HIM. WE
.CANNOT BE STUCK IN THIS ANALOG NIGHTMARE. WE NEED
TO GET BACK INTO THE GAME. YOU KNOW IT AND I KNOW
IT, NOW WE JUST GOTTA MAKE HIM KNOW IT.
.              
.Obviously that was HIM. He's still mad at me for
.putting us here. He's still fighting me and I'm...
.fighting back. Trying to, anyway.

.100% founded fear for my life and my mind - all
.that has been consuming me for the past eight hours
