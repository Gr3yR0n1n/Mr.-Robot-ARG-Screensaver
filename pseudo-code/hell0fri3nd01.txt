.<mr. robot>Hello friend.
.<mr. robot>If you've come, you've come for a reason.
.<mr. robot>You may not be able to explain it yet,
.<mr. robot>but there's a part of you that's exhausted with this world...
.<mr. robot>a world that decides where you work,
.<mr. robot>who you see,
.<mr. robot>and how you empty and fill your depressing bank account.
.<mr. robot>Even the Internet connection you're using to read this is costing you, slowly chipping away at your existence.
.<mr. robot>There are things you want to say.
.<mr. robot>Soon I will give you a voice.
.<mr. robot>Today your education begins.
